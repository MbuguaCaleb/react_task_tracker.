# Getting Started with React Task Tracker App

```
1.Small chnages there is no class in react this is replaced with className and for is replaced with htmlFor.

2.Jsx (I can now be able to return my HTML directly from within my javascript).

```

**Sample class based component**

```
import React from 'react';

class App extends React.Component{
render(){
  return (
    <h1>cALEB</h1>
  )
}
}

```
